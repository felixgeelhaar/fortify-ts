# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Fortify TS seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please Do

- **Report security vulnerabilities privately** by emailing [security@example.com] or using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Include steps to reproduce if possible
- Allow reasonable time for us to respond and fix the issue before public disclosure

### Please Don't

- Open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it
- Share information about the vulnerability with others before it's fixed

## What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

## Security Measures in This Library

Fortify-TS implements several security measures:

### 1. Prototype Pollution Prevention

Context objects are filtered for dangerous keys (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) in the logging package to prevent prototype pollution attacks.

### 2. Input Validation

All configuration uses Zod schemas with strict validation and bounds checking:
- Maximum token limits to prevent integer overflow
- Timestamp validation with reasonable bounds
- Type-safe parsing that rejects invalid data

### 3. Storage Key Sanitization

Rate limiter keys are sanitized to prevent injection attacks:
- Path traversal prevention (`../` sequences)
- Null byte removal
- Control character filtering
- Key length limiting (256 chars max)

### 4. Secure Error Handling

Sensitive data (like rate limit keys) is excluded from error serialization by default via `toJSON()` methods.

### 5. No Dynamic Code Execution

No use of `eval()`, `Function()`, or other dynamic code execution patterns.

## Security Best Practices

When using Fortify TS in your applications:

### Rate Limiting

- Always use rate limiting on public-facing APIs
- Configure appropriate limits based on your use case
- Consider per-user and per-IP rate limits
- Be mindful of what data you use as rate limit keys (avoid raw PII)

### Circuit Breaker

- Set appropriate failure thresholds
- Monitor circuit breaker state changes
- Configure reasonable timeout values

### Timeout

- Always set timeouts on external calls
- Use appropriate timeout values for your SLAs
- Handle timeout errors gracefully

### External Storage

- When using external storage adapters (Redis, etc.), ensure connections are properly secured
- Use TLS for storage connections in production
- Validate data retrieved from external storage

### Logging

- Be mindful of what data you log
- The library's `toJSON()` methods exclude sensitive data by default
- Don't expose internal error details to end users

### Input Validation

- Validate all configuration inputs
- Use Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Don't trust user-provided configuration without validation

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new versions and publish security advisory

## Recognition

We appreciate the security research community's efforts in helping keep Fortify TS and its users safe. Contributors who report valid security issues will be acknowledged in our release notes (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).
